Please note: below are the  list of steps not taken care on this project due to time constraint.

1. Input validation of longitude and latitude field is not taken care of. So please provide valid longitude and latitude.
2. Test cases are not written yet. I will try to add them if I get some time in weekends.
3. Geo Fence radious is hard coded to 500 meters.
